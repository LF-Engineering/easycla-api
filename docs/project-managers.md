# Project Managers
Project managers have responsibilities such as managing a projectâ€™s GitHub organization or Gerrit instance, members, repositories, and legal aspects like the CLA. You use the CLA Management Console.

Do the following CLA set-up steps after you [sign in to the CLA Management Console](sign-in-to-the-cla-management-console.md):

1. [Install the EasyCLA Application](install-the-easycla-application.md).

1. [Add a CLA Group](add-a-cla-group.md).

1. [Add Contributor License Agreements](add-contributor-license-agreements.md).

1. [Add Gerrit Instances to CLA Monitoring or Delete Them From CLA Monitoring](add-gerrit-instances-to-cla-monitoring-or-delete-them-from-cla-monitoring.md).

At any time, you can change the settings to manage your project CLA monitoring, and do other management tasks:

* [View Current and Previous CLA PDFs](view-current-and-previous-cla-pdfs.md)

* [Manage CLA Group Details](manage-cla-group-details.md)
