1. Click a **project name** of interest.

   For each project, the CLA Management Console provides the following information:

   * **GitHub Organizations** shows the organizations to which you have connected to the CLA Management Console. Organizations are shared accounts where companies and open source projects can collaborate across many projects at once.

   * **CLA Groups** shows the CLA groups that you have added to the project. A CLA group defines one or more CLA types that contributors must sign.

      * **GitHub Repositories** shows the repositories that you have configured to require CLA monitoring for pull requests.

      * **Gerrit Instances** shows the Gerrit instances that you have added to require CLA monitoring for pushes.
