# Contributor Console Video Script (Verbatim)
EasyCLA is designed to integrate seamlessly with your team's workflow.

Once installed and configured, EasyCLA verifies that each pull request author is authorized under assigned CLA. 

Make a pull request within an EasyCLA-configured repository. 

If you are already authorized under a signed CLA, then you'll see the badge "CLA Signed" associated with your pull request.

If you are not yet authorized, a "CLA Not Signed" badge will appear along with the link to review and begin the signature process.

Click on the link.

Authorize the app.

If you're contributing on your own, rather than on behalf of a company, jump to the timestamp (2:00) displayed on the screen.

If you're contributing on behalf of a company, click the "Corporate" block.

Select your company.

Confirm your affiliation with the company. 

In some instances, projects will require you to also sign an ICLA on top of the CCLA.

Open the ICLA page.

Wait for the document to load, then click the button. Press "Continue."

Click Finish.

Reload, if necessary.

Now, you're done.

Now, we'll return to the steps for individual contributors.

Press Continue.

Click "Finish" Press reload if necessary.

Now, you're done.
