# EasyCLA FAQs

**Who do I contact to enable my Linux Foundation-hosted project to use EasyCLA?**

Go to <https://cloud.email.thelinuxfoundation.org/EasyCLA> and submit a form to describe your particular needs, and import your existing CLAs.

**Why does the Linux Foundation ask contributors to some project to sign CLAs?**

Some project communities have elected to use CLAs as a required step for contributions to their code. For those that have, the Linux Foundation wants to ensure that contributions comply with the IP policies of that project, including ensuring that contributors have accepted the corresponding CLA.

**What is the difference between the Corporate CLA and the Individual CLA?**

A Corporate CLA needs to be in place if you are contributing code on behalf of your employer. A Corporate CLA should be signed by an individual who is authorized to enter into it on behalf of the company. After the Corporate CLA is signed, your email address needs to be included in a whitelist that is associated with your employer for this project. A CCLA manager for your company is responsible for managing the whitelists.

An Individual CLA is signed by an individual for contributions that they contribute on their own behalf, as opposed to contributions on behalf of their employer or another entity.

**Which Corporate CLA whitelist option has the lowest maintenance overhead?**

The Domain Whitelist option requires less overhead for CCLA signatories and CCLA managers because it allows entities to contribute under any email address under that domain name. When CCLA signatories and CCLA managers use the Email Whitelist instead of the Domain Whitelist, they must use the tool to add an email address every time a new company contributor joins the project. Therefore, using the Domain Whitelist requires less overhead because CCLA signatories and CCLA managers do not need to add and manage numerous employee email addresses.

**I contribute to an open source project as an employee for a company. Do I need to complete, sign, and submit a DocuSign document?**

Probably not. If your company's CCLA signatory has signed a Corporate CLA, and if you have been whitelisted under that company's CLA, then you simply confirm your association to the company during your code submission process.

If you are the first one from your company who has contributed to the project, then your company's CCLA signatory will need to sign a Corporate CLA as part of the EasyCLA process. Depending on the company, you might be an authorized CCLA signatory, but you will need to review with your company's leadership or legal counsel if you are not certain.

And if your company has already signed a Corporate CLA, but you are not yet on your company's whitelist, then you will need to be whitelisted by your company's CCLA manager as part of the EasyCLA process.

**If my project community has elected to use CLAs as a required step for contributions to their code, do I need to be authorized under a CLA for each project to which I contribute?**

Yes, provided that the project has a CLA.

* If you are contributing as an individualâ€”you must sign an Individual CLA for each project to which you contribute.

* If you are contributing as an employee of a company, your company's CCLA signatory must sign a Corporate CLA.

**Do I have to sign a CLA every time I contribute code?**

Signing a CLA for a project covers all code contributions to that project. You may, however, need to sign additional CLAs if you choose to contribute to other projects that require CLAs.
