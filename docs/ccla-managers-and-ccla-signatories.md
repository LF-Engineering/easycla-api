# CCLA Managers and CCLA Signatories
As the CCLA manager or the CCLA signatory, you do the following CLA tasks after you [sign in to the CLA Corporate Console](sign-in-to-the-cla-corporate-console.md):

1. CCLA manager: [Add a Company to a Project](add-a-company-to-a-project.md).

1. CCLA signatory: [Sign a Corporate CLA on behalf of the company](sign-a-corporate-cla-on-behalf-of-the-company.md) and  [Review and Sign a Corporate CLA by Request](review-and-sign-a-corporate-cla-by-request.md)—this signatory has legal authority to sign documents on behalf of the company.

1. CCLA manager: [Whitelist Contributors](whitelist-contributors.md)—each whitelist applies to the project for which the company has signed a Corporate CLA.

At any time, you can change the settings to manage your project CLA monitoring, and do other management tasks:

* [Add or Delete CCLA Managers](add-or-delete-ccla-managers.md)

* [View Employee Acknowledgements](view-employee-acknowledgements.md)

* [Edit the Company Name and Manager Details](edit-the-company-name-and-manager-details.md)
